# Dodge the Barrel 🎮🔥  

**Welcome to Dodge the Barrel**, a fast-paced 2D pixel art game where your goal is simple: dodge falling explosive barrels and survive as long as you can!  

This game was proudly created by me, a **15-year-old developer**, using Python and the amazing [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. It’s my first game, and I’ve poured my passion for coding and pixel art into it. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
